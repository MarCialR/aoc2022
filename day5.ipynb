       "\n",
       "The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked **crates** , but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The ship has a **giant cargo crane** capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The Elves don't want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her **which** crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.\n",

       "Then, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:\n",
