       "Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique **ID number** , and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.\n",

       "However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments **overlap** . To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a **big list of the section assignments for each pair** (your puzzle input).\n",
