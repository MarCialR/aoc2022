       "The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant [Rock Paper Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) tournament is already in progress.\n",

       "\n",
       "Rock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\n",

       "Appreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an **encrypted strategy guide** (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. \"The first column is what your opponent is going to play:A``for Rock,B``for Paper, andC``for Scissors. The second column--\" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.\n",

       "\n",
       "The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your **total score** is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the **shape you selected** (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the **outcome of the round** (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\n",

       "+ In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A``), and you should choose Paper (Y``). This ends in a win for you with a score of **8** (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\n",
       "+ In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B``), and you should choose Rock (X``). This ends in a loss for you with a score of **1** (1 + 0).\n",
